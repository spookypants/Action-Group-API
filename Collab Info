API Endpoint
https://api.seatgeek.com/2

Resource Endpoints
/events
/events/{EVENT_ID}
/performers
/performers/{PERFORMER_ID}
/venues
/venues/{VENUE_ID}


LOCATION SEARCH BOX:
1. "Location" argument cannot be used with the performers "endpoint" (gives a 400 error)
2. Location cannot be meaningfully used with venues because it gives back venues as results not events.
3. So the only viable option is to use the "events" endpoint in the query.
4. The API only accepts LAT and LON or Zips as a filter so we are tied to Zips until we get Google maps API to give Location pooints based off of city and state.
5. We can however provide a range option with a Zip option for the "Location" argument.
6. We also have an option to use the "Venue" argument (Venue.City and/or Venue.State etc...)

VENUE SEARCH BOX:
1. Searching the API's venue endpoint returns a list of venues (not events)
2. We can list those instead of listing events and then list events when a venue is selected on a new page.
3. This does return "number of upcoming events"
4. Or, to keep it simple, we can just use the "q" argument which pulls anything and everything that resembles the search string.

PERFORMER SEARCH BOX
1. similar to the "venue" end point, we can use the "performers" end point to return performers instead of events.
2. then list the events off of the performer tha the user selects.
3. We are currently pulling off of the "events" endpoint even when we search by performer.


DATE FILTERS:
1. Start date and end date can be used as follows:
    datetime_local.gte=2013-04-01&datetime_local.lt=2013-05-01
