### OUR APP

# App name : event+

### General Idea
An online dashboard app which assembles information from SeatGeek and Youtube APIs based on the user search
Possible future additions: Twitter, GoogleMaps, Lodging, Weather, Uber.

### Target Audience
Users who like to attend events and want a convenient way to assemble and store local information relevant to events they intend to attend

### Primary Problem
It can be difficult to easily assemble event relevant information to help plan events

### Primary Goal
To provide a dashboard/platform to assemble information, resources, and media relevant to events a user may plan to attend

### Identify and Prioritize User Stories
As a _____, I want _____, so that I can _____;

As a USER, I want TO BE ABLE TO ASSEMBLE RELEVANT INFORMATION AND MEDIA REGARDING EVENTS WHICH I PLAN TO ATTEND, so that I can ENGAGE MEANINGFULLY AND COMPREHENSIVELY WITH THOSE EVENTS;

### How it Works
 The search bar allows the user to search events by performer, venue or location. The search results are displayed with information on time, location and ticket prices (in a graph as well as text). The user can click on a particular event to pop-up relevant details and a link to the SeatGeek ticketing site.
